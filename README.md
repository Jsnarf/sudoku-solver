# Sudoku Solver

Goal of this project is to solve sudoku  


# How to run it ?

    python2.7 main.py
    

Or directly with an IDE like PyCharm.  
      
    
# TODOs :

- Add others algorithms to check if a number could be picked 
- Add a checker on sudoku output (to check answer is correct)
- Add a simple interface to put your sudoku 
- Maybe add parallelism on computations if hypothesis are needed on some cases
(ex: this case could have 2 or 3, just make an 2 hypothesis (one with 2, other with 3 and try to solve it))
- Add full variabilization on sudoku size
- Add calculation of time needed to solve sudoku
